## Overview

This PKM system is designed to help you capture, organize, and retrieve information efficiently. It's based on a combination of proven note-taking methodologies and is optimized for use with text editors and IDEs.

## Directory Structure

```
knowledge-base/
|--inbox/
|--projects/
|--topics/
|--archive/
|--templates/
```

- `inbox/`: For new notes and quick captures
- `projects/`: For project-specific notes and documentation
- `topics/`: For general knowledge and concept notes
- `archive/`: For old or no longer relevant notes
- `templates/`: Stores note templates

Note: To maintain this structure in the git repository, each directory contains a `.gitkeep` file. You can delete these files once you start adding your own notes.

## Note Types and Naming Conventions

1. Daily Notes: `YYYY-MM-DD-daily.md`
2. Meeting Notes: `YYYY-MM-DD-meeting-brief-description.md`
3. Project/Topic Analysis: `YYYY-MM-DD-analysis-project-or-topic-name.md`
4. General Notes: `YYYY-MM-DD-note-brief-description.md`
5. Code/Technical Documentation: `YYYY-MM-DD-code-component-or-feature-name.md`
6. Project MOC (Map of Content): `project-name-moc.md`

## Templates

The `templates/` directory contains starter templates for different note types:

- Daily Note Template
- Meeting Note Template
- Project/Topic Analysis Template
- Project MOC Template
- General Note Template
- Code/Technical Documentation Template

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pkm-starter-kit.git`
2. 2. Remove the `.gitkeep` files if desired.
3. Start creating notes in the `inbox/` directory using the provided templates.
4. Regularly review and organize notes into the appropriate directories.

## Best Practices

1. Always start new notes in the `inbox/` directory.
2. Use consistent tagging (e.g., #project-name, #topic, #meeting).
3. Link related notes using `[[note-name]]` syntax.
4. Regularly review and update your notes, moving them to appropriate directories.
5. Use the Project MOC (Map of Content) to maintain an overview of larger projects.
