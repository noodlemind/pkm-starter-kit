# PKM System Cheat Sheet

## Directory Structure
- `inbox/`: New notes and quick captures
- `projects/`: Project-specific notes and documentation
- `topics/`: General knowledge and concept notes
- `archive/`: Old or no longer relevant notes
- `templates/`: Note templates

## File Naming Convention
- General: `YYYY-MM-DD-type-brief-description.md`
- Daily Notes: `YYYY-MM-DD-daily.md`
- Meeting Notes: `YYYY-MM-DD-meeting-brief-description.md`
- Project/Topic Analysis: `YYYY-MM-DD-analysis-project-or-topic-name.md`
- General Notes: `YYYY-MM-DD-note-brief-description.md`
- Code Documentation: `YYYY-MM-DD-code-component-or-feature-name.md`
- Project MOC: `project-name-moc.md`

## Tagging System
- Use hashtags (#) for all tags
- Common tags: #daily, #meeting, #project, #topic, #idea, #question
- Project-specific tags: #project-[project-name]
- Component-specific tags: #[component-name]
- Technology tags: #[technology-name]
- Process tags: #planning, #review, #brainstorming
- Status tags: #in-progress, #completed, #blocked

## Linking
- Use wiki-style links: [[note-name]]

## Task Management
- Open task: `- [ ] Task description`
- Completed task: `- [x] Task description`
- Question: `- [?] Question`
- Idea: `IDEA: Idea description`

## Templates Usage
1. Daily Note: Use for daily logs and quick captures
2. Meeting Note: Use for documenting meetings and discussions
3. Project/Topic Analysis: Use for in-depth analysis of projects or topics
4. Project MOC: Use as an index for large projects
5. General Note: Use for miscellaneous information
6. Code Documentation: Use for technical documentation of code or systems

## Best Practices
1. Start new notes in the `inbox/` directory
2. Use consistent tagging and linking
3. Regularly review and organize notes
4. Update Project MOCs frequently
5. Use anchors for navigation in longer notes
6. Conduct daily, weekly, and monthly reviews of your PKM system

## Workflow
1. Capture: Create new notes in `inbox/`
2. Process: Review and organize notes regularly
3. Connect: Link related notes and update MOCs
4. Review: Conduct regular reviews to maintain and improve your system

Remember: The key to a successful PKM system is consistent use and regular review. Adapt the system as needed to fit your workflow.
